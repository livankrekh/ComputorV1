# ComputorV1

This project solve simple equation with degree less than 2

## Run: ./computor.py -d "equation #1" "equation #2" ...

flag -d for solve details

For example: ./computor.py "20x + 12x^2 - 123134 = -x^1 + 10*121^12"
Output:
> Polynomial degree is: 2
> Reduced form: 12.0 * X^2 + 21.0 * X + -9.849732675807607e+25 = 0
> The solution is: x1 = -2864980028408.2295 , x2 = 2864980028406.4795
